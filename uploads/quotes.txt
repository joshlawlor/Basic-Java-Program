Now I did a job. I got nothing but trouble since I did it, not to mention more than a few unkind words as regard my character so let me make this abundantly clear. I do the job. And then I get paid.

You have reputation! Malcolm Reynolds gets it done, is the talk.
You know what is reputation? Is people talking, is gossip. I also have reputation; not so pleasant, I think you know. Crow!
Now for you, my reputation is not from gossip. You see this man? Ehh, he does not do the job. I show you what I do with him, and now for you, my reputation is fact. Is solid. You do the train job for me; then you are solid.
You do not like I kill this man?
My wife’s nephew. At dinner, I am getting earful. There is no way out of that.
Anything goes wrong, then your reputation only gossip, and things between us not so solid. Yes?

Sure, I got a secret. More'n one. Don't seem likely I'd tell 'em to you, do it? Anyone off Dyton Colony knows better'n to talk to strangers. You're talking loud enough for the both of us, though, ain't you? I've known a dozen like you. Skipped off home early, minor graft jobs here and there. Spent some time in the lock-down, I warrant, but less than you claim. Now you're what, petty thief with delusions standing? Sad little king of a sad little hill.

Listen, you don’t know me, son, so I’m gonna say this once: if I ever kill you, you’ll be awake, you’ll be facing me, and you’ll be armed.

Dear Diary, Today I was pompous, and my sister was crazy. Today we were kidnapped by hill folk, never to be seen again. It was the best day ever.

Y'all see the man hanging out of the spaceship with the really big gun? Now I'm not saying you weren't easy to find. It was kinda out of our way, and he didn't want to come in the first place. Man's lookin' to kill some folk. So really, it's his will y'all should worry about thwarting.
